        <h2> 1 Sphaghetti </h2>
        <p> Sphaghetti is a classic ltalian pasta dish with eggs, pancetta,and parmesan cheese </p>
        <h3> INGRENDIENTS </h3>
            <li>1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)</li>
            <li>3 to 4 whole eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)</li>
            <li> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <h3> INSTRUCTIONS </h3>
        <li>1. Heat the pasta water: Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.) </hi>
        <li>2. Sauté the pancetta or bacon and garlic: While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl </li>
        <li>3. Beat the eggs and half of the cheese: In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese </li>
        <li>4. Cook the pasta: Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil </li>
        <li>5. Toss the pasta with pancetta or bacon: When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That's the tricky part.)</li>
        <li>6. Add the beaten egg mixture: Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out </li>

        <h2> 3 Sushi </h2>
        <p> Sushi is a japanese dish made with vinegared rice and various ingrendients </p>
        <h3> INGRENDIENTS </h3>
            <li> 2 cups (400 g) of sushi rice </li>
            <li> 3 cups (710 mL) of cold water </li>
            <li> 0.25 cups (59 mL) of rice vinegar </li>
            <li> ¼ cup (25 g) of granulated sugar </li>
            <li> 1 tsp (5.7 g) of salt </li>
            <li> 1 pack of unseasoned nori (seaweed sheets) </li>
            <li> Sliced vegetables </li> 
            <li> Sliced fish or seafood </li>
            <li> Pickled ginger (optional) </li> 
            <li> Wasabi (optional) </li>      
        <h3> INSTRUCTIONS </h3>
        <li>1. Lay 1 piece of nori onto a bamboo mat. Arrange a bamboo mat onto a flat surface, where you’ll be able to assemble all of your ingredients. If you want to keep your bamboo mat clean, chef Daniel Siriban recommends a piece of "plastic wrap under the maki so that you're not touching the sushi rice with the roller." Next, take a flat sheet of nori, or dried seaweed, and arrange it 1 in (2.5 cm) away from the edge of the mat. It doesn’t matter if the nori is centered perfectly—all that matters is that it’s completely flat </li>
        <li>2. Layer ½ to 1 cup (100-200 g) of sushi rice over the nori sheet. Moisten your fingertips with cool water so the rice doesn’t stick to your fingers, then scoop a small amount out of the bowl or cooking sheet. Start arranging the rice along the surface of the nori, leaving 0.25 in (0.64 cm) of space along the outer edge of the sheet. Continue adding rice until the most of the seaweed is covered in a thin layer of rice </li>
        <li>3. Arrange your ingredients lengthwise on top of the rice. Lay your slices of fish and vegetables across the center of sushi rice. If you’re feeling especially creative, try using specific ingredient combinations to make special, well-known sushi rolls. Try aligning your strips of meat and vegetable as though you’re drawing a line down the middle of the rice, so the sushi will be easier to roll up </li>
        <li>4. Roll up the bamboo mat so only 0.25 to 1 inch (0.64 to 2.54 cm) of nori is visible. Use both hands to push the edge of the mat forward, rolling it up in the same way that you’d roll a piece of cloth or paper. Continue rolling the bamboo along the outside of the nori, rice, and fillings, tucking the ingredients into a rounded shape. Once you reach the section of nori without any rice, stop rolling the bamboo </li>
        <li>5. Squeeze the top and sides of the bamboo mat to form the sushi roll. Use your fingers to pinch around the sides and surface of the bamboo mat, forming the sushi roll into your desired shape. As you pinch and squeeze your food, note that the sushi roll itself will resemble a slight square shape. Keep pinching until you’re satisfied with the way that your sushi looks </li>
        <li>6. Unroll the bamboo and remove the sushi. Pull the bamboo mat backwards, using slow and delicate motions to reveal your finished roll of sushi. Use both hands to lift and move your roll to a cutting board. If the sushi looks like it’s about to unravel, try squeezing it within the bamboo mat for a little longer </li>
        <li>7. Slice the sushi into 6 equally-sized pieces. Take a large knife and begin cutting the roll in half. Chef Daniel Siriban recommends: "make sure that your knife has a bit of moisture; it's good to dip the edge of the knife in a bath of water." Do this before you begin cutting as well as between each slice to prevent the rice from sticking to the knife </li>

        <h3> INSTRUCTIONS </h3>
        <li>1. Tortillas or hard-shell-Soft tortilla or hard-shell tacos—you decide! Either way, they’re both fun to eat and you can pile on the toppings as much as you want </li>
        <li>2. Ground Beef-Ask the butcher at your meat shop or grocery to grind your choice cuts on the spot. Not only will you get the freshest meat possible, but this also ensures your tacos taste extra crazy-good </li>
        <li>3. Taco Seasoning-Grab a pack at the grocery and mix them into your ground meat once it is browned. Make sure to follow package instructions on proportions </li>
        <li>4. Onions-Dice white or red onions and add them to your taco. Use as little or as much as you want </li>

        <li>8. Cheese-Cheddar, Jack cheese, or whatever kind of cheese you prefer, grate it and pile your tacos with as much as you want. Go for store-bought shredded cheese if you have less time on your hands to prep </li>
        <li>9. Lime, Guacamole, Avocado, Hot Sauce-Squeeze limes over them, add avocado chunks, or drizzle a few drops of hot sauce—these are optional! The best part about tacos is that you don’t always need a recipe and they can be made on the fly. Dig in </li>

        <h2> 7 Burgers </h2>
        <p> Bergers is a sandwich consisting pf a patty of ground meat, typically beef, served on a bun with various toppings </p>   
        <h3> INGRENDIENTS </h3>
            <li> 1 ½ pounds ground chuck* , (80/20) </li>
            <li> 1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li> 2 teaspoon paprika </li>
            <li> 1/2 teaspoon light brown sugar </li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder </li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon onion powder </li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper </li>
        <h3> INSTRUCTIONS </h3>
        <li>1. Make burger seasoning by combining all spices in a bowl. Set aside </li>
        <li>2. Form Patties: Divide ground chuck into 6 equal portions and gently form into ½ inch thick patties that are wider than the burger buns, since the meat will shrink as it cooks. (Don't over-handle the meat, or it will make it tough) </li>
        <li>3. Indent: Use your thumb to press a gentle indentation into the center of each patty, which will help them cook evenly and not puff up in the center. Cover and set aside while preheating grill. (Ice cube trick: Some chefs will put an ice cube on top of each indentation on the patties until they’re ready to cook, so they don't dry out) </li>
        <li>4. Grill: Preheat grill to medium high heat. Just before cooking, sprinkle burger seasoning over the patties, then place on hot grill, indent-side up. Close grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the bottom of the burger is seared and juices are accumulating on top of the burger. Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes, or until the beef reaches 160 degrees F </li>
        <li>5. Add cheese on top of burger patties during the last minute of cooking. Remove to a plate and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving on a bun, with desired toppings </li>

        <li>8. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese </li>
        <li>9. Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes </li>
        <li>10. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving </li>

            <li>1 large egg </li>              
            <li> 1/2 cup plus 1/3 cup olive oil </li>             
            <li>3 cloves garlic, finely grated </li>              
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano </li>              
            <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes </li>
            <li>Two 28-ounce cans diced tomatoes </li>    
            <li>3 sprigs basil, plus torn leaves for serving </li>

            <li> 12 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <h3> INSTRUCTIONS </h3>
        <li>1. Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet. Line another rimmed baking sheet with foil. Cut two 12-inch sheets of plastic wrap </li>
        <li>2. Cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise, making 4 roughly equal pieces; they should look like large chicken tenders. Place one sheet of plastic on a clean cutting board. Put one chicken piece in the center of the plastic and top with the other sheet of plastic. Pound the chicken with the flat side of a meat mallet, starting in the center and working your way to the edges, until the chicken is 1/4-inch thick. Transfer to the wire rack. Repeat with the remaining chicken, one piece at a time. Liberally sprinkle with salt and pepper </li>
        <li>3. Put the flour in a pie plate and dredge the chicken 1 piece at a time, turning to coat and packing the flour into the crevices. Shake to remove any excess and return to the rack. Repeat with the remaining chicke </li>
        <li>4. Whisk the breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup of the Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a medium bowl until combined. Whisk the milk and egg in a medium bowl until combined. Dip the dredged chicken into the milk mixture, allowing any excess to drip off. Then pack the seasoned breadcrumbs firmly onto the chicken. Very gently </li>
        <li>5. shake off any excess and return to the rack. Refrigerate uncovered at least 30 minutes and up to 12 hours </li>
        <li>6. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Heat 1/3 cup of the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the garlic, oregano and red pepper flakes and cook until very fragrant but not brown, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil and then reduce to a simmer and cook, uncovered, until the tomatoes are very tender and the liquid has reduced by half, about 30 minutes. Smash the tomatoes with a potato masher until almost smooth; it's ok if it's a little chunky. Season with salt </li>
        <li>7. Heat the remaining 1/2 cup oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 cutlets and cook until the coating is golden brown, about 1 minute per side; the chicken will not be cooked through. Transfer to the foil-lined baking sheet in a single layer 3 inches apart. Repeat with the remaining cutlets </li>
        <li>8. Arrange an oven rack directly under the broiler and preheat to high. Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet, spaced 3 inches apart. Top each cutlet with 2/3 cup of the sauce and spread evenly to coat. Sprinkle each cutlet with 1 tablespoon of the Parmesan and 1/2 cup mozzarella. Broil until the cheese melts and starts to brown in spots, 2 to 3 minutes </li>
        <li>9. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Cook the spaghetti, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain and transfer to the remaining sauce. Gently stir until the sauce coats the pasta. Transfer the spaghetti to a serving dish and top with the chicken. Sprinkle with more Parmesan and serve with torn basil </li>
